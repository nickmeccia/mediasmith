# QA to-do — todo-4/5 refactor (Fable session, 2026-08-12)

Everything from this refactor that needs Nick's eyes or renames after it
lands. (Named "todo-2.md" per your instruction during the session.)

## Color theme (todo-4 "Color Theme Stylesheet")

- [ ] All colors now live in `mediasmith/theme.py` (your palette,
      verbatim); CSS holds only state (which token applies when). Nothing
      else in the app may name a hex — future Claudes included.
- [ ] Eyeball the scrollbar tracks: your spec says `transparent`; the old
      design matched them to each pane's background because a transparent
      track didn't always blend. If a track renders black, the fix is one
      token pair in theme.py (`scrollbar-track-*`).
- [ ] Idle-view dimming is now real: unfocused panes drop to grey-40 text
      / grey-30 borders per your palette. Verify readability on the NAS
      browse (SMB latency means you'll stare at idle panes plenty).
- [ ] Hidden files (dotfiles) now dim to the `node-hidden-fg-*` pair —
      this styling is NEW (they used to render like any file).
- [ ] Buttons: chord glyphs dim with the pane (grey-40), light to primary
      when Details view holds focus, flip to grey-90 on the selected
      (arrow-highlighted) button. The old focused-button look (orange bg,
      black text) is now primary bg / grey-90 text per your palette.
